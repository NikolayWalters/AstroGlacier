# AstroGlacier

Welcome to the AstroGlacier repository! This repository houses a collection of messy development Jupyter Notebooks focused on astrophysics data analysis, data wrangling, plotting, and experimentation. These notebooks represent my journey of exploring various techniques and trying out different approaches in astrophysical data analysis.

Please note that these notebooks are primarily intended for personal development and experimentation, and as a result, they lack proper documentation, comments, and may be challenging to follow. They are a snapshot of my exploration process and may contain unfinished code, experiments, and alternative approaches.

## Notebooks

The repository contains a large number of Jupyter Notebooks, each representing a specific aspect of astrophysics data analysis. These notebooks cover a range of topics, including:

- Data wrangling and preprocessing techniques
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Visualization and plotting
- Working with different data types and formats
- Experimental code snippets and ideas

## Viewing Notebooks

To make it easier to preview the notebooks directly on GitHub, this repository is integrated with ReviewNB. ReviewNB provides a notebook preview feature that allows you to view the notebooks without having to install Jupyter locally. However, please note that due to the size of some of the larger notebooks, the preview functionality may not work optimally for all notebooks.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository and gain insights into my development process and experimentation in the field of astrophysics data analysis. While the code may be messy and uncommented, it reflects my genuine efforts to understand and apply various techniques.

Please keep in mind that these notebooks are provided as-is, without any guarantees or warranties. They are not production-ready code but rather a collection of experimental and developmental work.

## Feedback and Contact

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions you may have regarding the notebooks in this repository. If you have any insights or ideas for improvement, feel free to reach out to me through the contact information provided in my GitHub profile.
